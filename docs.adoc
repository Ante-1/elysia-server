= Development Process

== First Steps
- heard from a friend that oracle has a free VPS offering
- follow oracle's guide to get ssh access
- install nodejs via nvm
- create hello world server
- copy it to the VPS via scp
- start and test it with the browser by entering the ip
- it is unreachable (as expected)

== Open Ports
 - need to open ports 80 and 443 (HTTP+HTTPS)
 - open oracle cloud
 - go to vps instance ->
 VNIC -> Subnet -> security lists
 - add port 80 + 443
 - install ufw to change firewall settings (easier than iptables)
 - allow 80/tcp, 443/tcp
 - I see the hello world page in the browser!

[source,bash]
----
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp 
----

== write script to get gas prices from gas station homepage
 - install bun (wanna try it more + has integrated Typescript)
 - fetch the data and parse it
 - save data to a file

== setup a bun server (elysia)
 - try different chart librarys
 - choose highsharts (seems like a good fit because of stack chart)
 - research API and format for supplied data
 - add data route that get's data from the file and adjust to the desired format
 - I see the chart in the browser!

== Automation
- setup cronjob that runs the script that get
the gas prices
`crontab -e` `0 * * * * /path/to/script.sh`
- redirect the logs to a file so you can see the errors `command >> /path/to/cronjob.log 2>&1`
- setup systemd service to start the elysia server
- learn that you have to use a lot absolute paths
- create a service file: `/etc/systemd/system/elysia-server.service`
- now the server starts automatically with the VPS. I can start, stop, restart and check the status with systemctl. I can check logs using journalctl

== Next steps
- add HTTPS with nginx
- maybe get a domain
- maybe get a better way to get my code on the VPS
 - git or docker
 - use config files like .env to test locally and on VPS
